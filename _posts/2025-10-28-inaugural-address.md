## Inaugural Address

Fireworks over the river<br>
But there's nothing to celebrate<br>
Warm my ice box enclosure, may we hesitate?<br>
To paint road markings over<br>
Blindfold the traffic lights, season our slipping meetings with grit<br>
Evacuate the constellations, surely they've seen enough?<br>
Rake in leaves during a hurricane<br>
Shake hands firmly with your shame<br>
Can't you accept, this looming cost?<br>
since those lives were lost<br>
At the cost of your fragility<br>
Mister President, all you do is sign eulogies
