## Inaugural Address

Fireworks over the river
But there's nothing to celebrate
Warm my ice box enclosure, may we hesitate?
To paint road markings over
Blindfold the traffic lights, season our slipping meetings with grit
Evacuate the constellations, surely they've seen enough?
Rake in leaves during a hurricane
Shake hands firmly with your shame
Can't you accept, this looming cost?
since those lives were lost
At the cost of your fragility
Mister President, all you do is sign eulogies
